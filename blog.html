    <h3>Hello World!</h3>

    <p>
      Welcome! This site is still very much under construction at the time I am writing this, but I think I need to prioritize getting it out into the world over perfection.  
    </p>
    <p>
      So expect lots of changes!
    </p>
    <p>
      The raison d'etre of this project is for me to start putting together a comprehensive personal resource guide. I hope one day it ends up being helpful to others too!
    </p>

    <h3>I'm not sure where I originally found this, but it has been great advice.</h3>
    <p>"I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel. I'm more than happy to adopt someone else's perfectly functioning wheel."</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with goals</li>
      <li>Create systems to achieve those goals</li>
      <li>Believe in yourself</li>
      <li>Believe you are in control of your life</li>
      <li>Still embrace "random"</li>
      <li>Find happiness in the success of others</li>
      <li>Use your goals to make decisions automatic
        <ul>
          <li>"Indecision is born of a lack of purpose"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Don't multi-task
        <ul>
          <li>"Do one thing incredibly well, then move on to what's next and to *that* incredibly well."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Freely ask for help</li>
      Want to be remarkably effective?
      <br> Surround yourself with people who trust and motivate and inspire you and in turn are inspired *by* you.
      <br> Even if you don't achieve all of your goals, your life will be infinitely richer.
    </ol>

    <h3>I need a citation here too.</h3>
    <p>Keep a list of your top life priorities somewhere that you see it many times per day. Stuff like better friendships,
      better parenting, health, financial independence, happiness, personal growth. Looking at this list before you decide
      to do anything – whether it’s planning a lunch or moving to a new house, can serve as a surprisingly powerful anchor
      to help you fine tune your happiness bumps – stretching out the good parts and eliminating the hangovers.</p>
